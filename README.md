# Advanced DDoS Attack Detection in SDN Using Machine Learning

This repository presents the full dataset, trained models, result plots, and evaluation metrics for the Masterâ€™s thesis titled:

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to enhance the detection and prediction of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks within Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using advanced machine learning techniques. The work focuses on using statistical features extracted from network flows to classify traffic as normal or attack with high precision and reliability.

The dataset was collected from a real SDN environment using Mininet and Ryu, and several ensemble and baseline machine learning models were trained and tested on this dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset consists of real-time traffic flows labeled as either "Normal" or "DDoS Attack". It includes key statistical features such as:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `flow_duration` | Duration of the network flow |
| `packet_rate`, `byte_rate` | Traffic volume metrics |
| `protocol`, `src_ip`, `dst_ip`, `src_port`, `dst_port` | Flow identifiers |
| `label` | Class label: 0 (Normal), 1 (Attack) |

The data was balanced and preprocessed before training the models.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were applied for classification:

- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT)
- AdaBoost

- **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**
- **Cohen's Kappa**, **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**, **False Negative Rate (FNR)**
- **Cross-Validated Accuracy**
